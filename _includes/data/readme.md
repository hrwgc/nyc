### Grab NYC Precinct-level Crime Statistics

#### Problem 1
 - NYPD offers [crime data as pdf reports](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/crime_prevention/crime_statistics.shtml) for each precinct as well as monthly one-page [citywide crime reports](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cscity.pdf).
 - PDF reports have structure, but need to be processed to allow for cross precinct and across-time comparisons.
